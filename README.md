# downslope-windstorms
Code to perform a climatology of chinooks, i.e. downslope windstorms in the Front Range of Colorado using data from NREL Flatirons Campus (M2)

Data from: https://midcdmz.nrel.gov/apps/daily.pl?site=NWTC&start=20010824

Reads in timeseries data and identifies how many windstorms occurred within that data set depending on required speed and duration of winds.
The number of storms are then plotted as both a contour and 3d plot.
